Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The coefficients the provided a non random amount of varianc in the data ste is vechile lenght, and ground cleareance. Vechile lenght p value is 2.60e-12 and ground clearenace is 5.21e-08. Each variable p value is below 0.05 whick shows a stasticily significaint relationship with MPG.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slop eont he this model would no tbe zero. with a small p-value we see that there is realtion between the variables 

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

This modle coul dbe used to predict mpg. With a r-squared value of .7149. this shows that changed to the cars has a realtionsghip to MPG in some cases like vechile lenght and ground clearenace.

Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils


The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

The variance for coils does meet the requirment of variance for less then 100 pounds per square inch. when we look at each lot seperaetaly only lot one and two are below 100 punds per square inch. Lot 3 faisl this standard with a variance of 170.29
